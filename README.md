# :mortar_board: q201
*Deepen your knowledge of q by studying the language systematically.*

This repo is a placeholder for a learning resource under development as a community resource.

From the Introduction:

> You probably learned q informally from workshop examples and colleagues. For many of us this is enough.
> 
> If you need more, q201 formalises, extends, and exercises your knowledge.

The content aims to help you write the kind of terse code for which the “q gods” are famous.

As the content is developed it is being tested by students in tutorials with the authors.
These tutorials are currently free of charge.
